# Gossip Glomers

Gossip Glomers is a distributed system challenge by fly.io - https://fly.io/dist-sys/

This is something that I have been wanting to do for a long time and finally getting my hands on! Let this git repo be a souvenir of that!

## Run

After installing necessary tools as mentioned [here](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/) and the `just` command runner. Feel free to run the following:

```
# for running the echo exercise
$ just echo

# for debugging maelstrom
$ just debug
```

## Learnings

I am noting down my learnings along the way here: https://github.com/scriptnull/vishnubharathi.codes/issues/41

It will probably turn out to be blog post(s).
